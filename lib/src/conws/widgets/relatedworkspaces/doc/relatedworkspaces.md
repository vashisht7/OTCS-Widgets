# Related workspaces widget (widgets/relatedworkspaces)

  The Related Workspaces widget provides a list of workspaces of a specific workspace type, which are related to one certain workspace.
  It allows for filtering on the workspaces by opening a search field and entering filter criteria.
  Clicking on a single workspaces opens the workspace.  
  The icon displayed in the header is the standard icon for business workspaces. If a specific icon
  for the workspace is configured in the server, this icon is used.

  The models and "query properties" like filtering and sorting for the collapsed and
  expanded view are independent of each other. For example, if a filter is set in the collapsed view, it has no effect on the expanded view.

## Features

* Collapsed view

  The displayed related workspaces properties list can be formatted through configuration.
It allows for filtering the workspaces by the configured title value. Currently filtering
is only supported for properties of type 'string'.
When scrolling the collapsed view to the end, the next page of workspaces are fetched from server.

* Expanded view

  The expanded view shows the following columns:
  *    **type**: The default icon for the related business workspace
  *    **name**: The related business workspace name
  *    **size**: The size of the related business workspace
  *    **modify_date**: The modify date of the related business workspace
  *    **favorite**: Interactive icon that indicates if the related business workspace is part of user favorites

  Additionally, custom columns are configurable.  

  **Important:** In Content Server, the value for **Column availability** must be set to **Available everywhere** for all columns.

  Filtering works on all columns and custom columns of type **string**, for example **name**.

  Sorting is possible for the related workspace name and the custom columns, where the **sortable** option is enabled.
