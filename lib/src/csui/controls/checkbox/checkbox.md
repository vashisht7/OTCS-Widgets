# Checkbox Control

**Module: csui/controls/checkbox/checkbox.view**

The checkbox.view.js implements a marionette.js view that renders a checkbox but without using a 
native html input type="checkbox" element. Instead it is displaying a custom styled checkbox 
depending on the checkbox state.

The checkbox.view creates a model in its constructor to store view state.

The attribute which stores the checked state is *checked* and can have these states:
* 'true'
* 'false'
* 'mixed'

## CheckboxView(options)

## Public Methods

The checkbox view has a backbone model for the state and aria-label text and is accessible via 
the view.

Additionally there are the following methods:

setDisabled(bool: disabled)
: render the checkbox as disabled and don't fire the clicked event

setChecked(string: checked)
: set the checked attribute in the view model and render the checkbox depending on its new 
checked value. See above for valid checked values.

## Events

clicked
: Triggers when the checkbox has been clicked or activated by space or enter key when in focus

Note that it is possible to use the views model to listen for additional backbone model events.
