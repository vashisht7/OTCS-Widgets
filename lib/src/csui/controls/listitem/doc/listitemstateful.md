# StatefulListItem (controls/listitem/listitemstateful.view)

  The StatefulListItem provides a simple list item, to be used in [ListView](#),
  which comprises an icon and a title, as description, and a state. All these properties are configurable and usually
  set by the list. All properties also facilitate a dynamic binding against a Backbone.Model given in the constructor. If text, description or state are too long for the available space, they are cut off and provided with ellipsis. The info can have a state which is set through the property infoState.

  When clicked, the item throws an event 'click:item'.


### Example

      var item = new Backbone.Model({
            name: 'John Doe',
            remark: 'A good guy.'
          }),
      slItem = new StatefulListItem({
        model: item,
        text: '{name}',
        description: '{remark}',
        info: 'active',
        infoState: 'Success',
        icon: 'icon-folder'
      });

      slItem.on("click:item", function () { alert('click:item raised')});
      slItem.render();
