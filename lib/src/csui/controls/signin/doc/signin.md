# SignInView (controls/signin)

  Shows a sign-in view. On submit, a sign-in is tried using
  RequestAuthenticator (utils/requestauthenticator), addressing the url given in options. On
  successful authentication, a 'success' event is raised. Otherwise a 'failure' event is raised,
  and the view shows an error message and sets an error state (marked input fields).
  Pressing enter while having focus in one of the input fields causes a submit. The submit button
   is disabled as long as the username field is empty. It is also disabled during
   the authentication operation.
   The following texts are localized: Placeholders of username and password input fields, text of
   submit button, error message.


### Example

    var contentRegion = new Marionette.Region({
          el: "#content"
        }),
        options = {
          connection: {
            url: 'api/v1',
            supportPath: '/alphasupport'
          }
        },
        control = new SignIn( options);

    control.render();
    control.on('success', function() {
      alert( "event 'success' raised.");
    });
    control.on('failure', function() {
      alert( "event 'failure' raised.");
    });
    contentRegion.show(control);
