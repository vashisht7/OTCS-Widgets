ModalAlert
==========

A modal alert dialog to notify about errors and other events, or to ask
a confirmation question.  You can configure:

* Title of the dialog
* Message in the dialog body
* Buttons in the dialog footer
* Other options like the close button in the dialog caption

Both clicking on the close button in the caption (if it is visible) or
hitting "Esc" cancel the dialog, like the "Cancel" button does.

Hitting "Enter" when no other button is focused clicks the default
(the first) button; usually "Yes" or "OK".

Modal alert dialogs are used to suspend the running operation and wait until
the user closes the dialog, but methods of this object are not synchronous
as the native `alert`.  They are asynchronous and resuming the
operation must continue in a function callback.

## Synopsis

```
// Report an error and wait for closing the alert dialog
ModalAlert.showError('You have no permissions to create a folder.')
  .always(function () {
    // Continue here when the dialog was closed
  });

// Make sure that the user does not accidentally delete the documents
ModalAlert.confirmWarning('The selected folder is not empty.' + 
    '\n\nAre you sure that you want to delete it?',
    'Folder Deletion')
  .done(function () {
    // Delete the folder
  });

// Ask the user how to resolve the document name conflict
ModalAlert.confirmQuestion('An existing document with the same name has been found.' + 
    '\n\nDo you want to replace it with the uploaded one?',
    'Document Name Conflict', {
      buttons: ModalAlert.buttons.YesNoCancel
    })
  .always(function (answer) {
    if (answer) {
      // Overwrite the existing document
    } else if (answer !== undefined) {
      // Append a new version to the existing document
    }
  });
```

## Interface

All public methods are static. They show the alert dialog and return a
promise to be able to wait until the dialog is closed. They start with
"show" or "confirm" to conveniently provide buttons usually needed for
notifications or confirmations. They end with an alert type like "Error",
to conveniently provide the usual look and feel for the particular notification
or confirmation.

### Notifications

The following methods show a notification alert as well as the "Close" button
by default:

* `showError`
* `showWarning`
* `showInformation`
* `showSuccess`
* `showMessage`

### Confirmations

The following methods show a confirmation alert as well as the "Yes" and "No"
buttons by default:

* `confirmError`
* `confirmWarning`
* `confirmInformation`
* `confirmSuccess`
* `confirmMessage`
* `confirmQuestion`

### Alert Types

The alert types carry default options for the alert dialog, which can be
overridden to customize the behavior for a special scenario.  They are exposed
as the second part of the method name after "show" or "confirm":

Error
: Suitable for reporting failed operations.

Warning
: Suitable for warning about unexpected or dangerous events, which do not
  prevent the operation from finishing, but the result should be checked.

Information
: Suitable for notifying about important events.

Success
: Suitable for notifying about successfully finished operations.

Message
: Suitable for common messages; shows no icon and no header colour; it gives
  no hint about the severity of the message.

Question
: Suitable for questions about non-destructive operations and available only
  by `confirmQuestion`; if the operation is dangerous, `confirmWarning` should
  be preferred.

### Buttons

The most usual button sets are exposed as keys of the `ModalAlert.buttons`
object:

* `YesNoCancel`
* `YesNo`
* `OkCancel`
* `Ok`
* `Cancel`
* `Close`

They can be used to override the buttons used by a particular alert showing
method by default.  They are supposed to be passed to the method by the property
`buttons` of the `options` parameter.

### Method Signatures

All alert showing methods share the same signature:

```text
(callback : function, message : string, title : string, options : object)
```

The `callback`, `title` and `options` parameters are optional, if the
`message` parameter is provided.  The `options` parameter can be passed in
alone, containing the other parameters as keys. If multiple parameters are passed in,
they must be provided in their declaration order. Calls with these arguments are
valid:

```javascript
(callback, message, title, options)
(message, title, options)
(message, options)
(message, title)
(message)
(callback, message, title)
(callback, message, options)
(callback, message)
(callback, options)
(options)
({
  message:  ...,
  title:    ...,
  callback: ...,
  ...
})
```

### Callbacks and Promises

A callback is called with a single argument depending on the button with
which the dialog was closed:

```javascript
// Process the answer of a confirmation dialog
function (result) {
  if (result === true) {
    // Dialog was closed by "Yes" (result is true)
  } if (result === false) {
    // Dialog was closed by "No" (result is false)
  } else {
    // Dialog was cancelled (result is undefined)
  }
}

// Just resume after closing the notification dialog
function () {
  // Continue the operation
}
```

A promise is either resolved with a single argument or rejected with no arguments
depending on the button with which the dialog was closed:

```javascript
// Process the answer of a confirmation dialog separately
.done(function (result) {
  // Dialog was closed by "Yes" (result is true)
})
.fail(function (result) {
  if (result !== undefined) {
    // Dialog was closed by "No" (result is false)
  } else {
    // Dialog was cancelled (result is undefined)
  }
})

// Process the answer of a confirmation dialog together
.always(function (result) {
  if (result) {
    // Dialog was closed by "Yes" (result is true)
  } else if (result !== undefined) {
    // Dialog was closed by "No" (result is false)
  } else {
    // Dialog was cancelled (result is undefined)
  }
})

// Just resume after closing the notification dialog
.always(function () {
  // Continue the operation
})
```

Summary of the dialog closing results:

Button clicked      | `result` value | Promise state
--------------------|----------------|----------------------
"Yes" or "OK"       | `true`         | resolved with `true`
"No"                | `false`        | rejected with `false`
"Cancel" or "Close" | `undefined`    | rejected with nothing

A callback is executed before the promise is resolved or rejected.

### Options

## Examples

The following examples show typical parameters of the `show` and `confirm`
methods.

```
require(['csui/dialogs/modal.alert/modal.alert',
], function (ModalAlert) {

  // Report an error
  ModalAlert.showError('Unable to import items. ' +
      'The items to import may have been moved or deleted.');

  // Warn about an incoming danger
  ModalAlert.showWarning('System maintenance is scheduled in 30 minutes. ' +
      'You will be automatically signed out at that time.');

  // Inform about an important event
  ModalAlert.showInformation('OpenText Content Server application ' +
      'has been updated to version 16.0',
    'Software Update');

  // Announce that an operation has succeeded
  ModalAlert.showSuccess('12 files have been successfully uploaded.',
    'Upload Succeeded');

  // Show a plain message without any status colour
  ModalAlert.showMessage('12 files have been successfully uploaded.',
    'Upload Succeeded');

  // Ask if the user is really sure to proceed
  ModalAlert.confirmQuestion('The selected folder contains 235 items.\n\n' +
      'Remove the selected folder?',
    'Remove');

  // Ask if the user agrees to proceed right now or not
  ModalAlert.confirmQuestion('The database needs to be upgraded before you continue.',
    'Database Maintenance', {
      buttons: ModalAlert.buttons.OkCancel
    });

});
```
