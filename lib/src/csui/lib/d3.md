**<h1>Information for developers using the d3.js library.</h1>**

Since d3 is a large library and we are only currently using a subset of features, we have performed a custom build using only the packages we need at the moment. The packages included in the current Smart UI build are:

* d3-selection
* d3-array
* d3-scale
* d3-shape
* d3-axis
* d3-collection
* d3-transition
* d3-interpolate
* d3-format

See https://github.com/d3 for more information on these packages and their APIs.
