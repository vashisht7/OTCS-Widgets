Attention - this directory can be removed anytime
=================================================

This directory contains modules adding node icons and click actions
redirecting to the Classic UI.  They belong to CS modules, which own
the respective node types.  They have been added here, so that they
would appear in Ollie as a hotfix as soon as possible.

When you delete this directory, remove also references to it from
`src/csui-extensions.json`, `src/csui-mobile-extensions.json`,
`src/Gruntfile.js`, `pkgcfg.xml`, and `pages/debug/config-demo.js`.
